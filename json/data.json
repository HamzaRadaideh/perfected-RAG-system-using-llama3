        "LLaMA": "As of 2020, the estimated population of Jordan is approximately 10.2 million people. The country has a relatively small population, but it's still one of the most populous countries in the Middle East.\n\nHere's a breakdown of Jordan's population growth:\n\n* 2015: 9.5 million\n* 2018: 9.7 million\n* 2020: 10.2 million (estimated)\n* 2025: 11.3 million (projected)\n\nJordan is a relatively small country, with a total area of around 89,342 square kilometers (34,455 sq mi). Its population density is approximately 120 people per square kilometer (310 people per square mile).\n\nIt's worth noting that Jordan has a high population growth rate compared to other countries in the region. This is largely due to a young and growing population, with around 30% of the population under the age of 15."
